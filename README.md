# 14_Belly-button-challenge

## 1) Executive Summary:
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset documents the microbes found in human belly buttons. It shows that some microbial species are common among people, while others are rare.
This project aims to build an interactive dashboard using D3.js and Plotly.js to explore this dataset, accessible via URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json

The live demo of the dashboard can be view here.

## 2) Project Objectives:
- Read the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from the provided URL using the D3 library.
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual's navel, using sample_values as the bar heights, otu_ids as labels, and otu_labels as hover text
- Develop a bubble chart to visualize all OTUs present in a sample, with otu_ids as x-values, sample_values as y-values and marker sizes, otu_ids as marker colors, and otu_labels as text values
- Display the sample metadata, i.e. demographic information about the selected individual, and updating the information whenever a new sample is selected
- Deploy the interactive dashboard to a free static page hosting service such as GitHub Pages

## 3) Resource Requirements:
- Technologies: D3.js, Plotly.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Dataset: Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (samples.json)
- External Libraries: D3.js, Plotly.js
- Development Environment: Web browser, code editor
- Hosting Service: GitHub Pages or similar free static page hosting service

## 4) Takeaways:
- Gain proficiency in using D3.js and Plotly.js for data visualization
- Understand how to read and manipulate JSON data using JavaScript
- Learn how to create interactive dashboards
- Practice deploying web applications to hosting services like GitHub Pages
- Enhance understanding of microbial diversity and its visualization techniques
